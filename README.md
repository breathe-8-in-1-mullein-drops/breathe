**What Is Breathe Drops?**
--------------------------

[Breathe Drops](https://startupcentrum.com/startup/breathe-8-in-1-mullein-drops), as suggested by the name, is a dietary tincture that aims to improve lung capacity and, therefore, one’s breathing pattern. This tincture might be worth considering for those prone to getting sick or suffering from acute illnesses such as bronchitis, as it is believed to help the lungs fully recover. As good as they are at self-healing, long-term damage will only prolong healing, forcing the airways to experience excess swelling, inflammation, and mucus buildup. Respiratory therapist Dr. Elizabeth Moffett teamed up with Herbal Tea Therapy to launch a formula that could support healthy breathing by clearing the lungs and chest of excess mucus. To understand how Breathe 8-IN-1 Mullein Drops works in the body, let’s focus on the underlying mechanism.

Moreover, the formulation is designed to address the root cause of breathing disorders, targeting the sticky proteins that contribute to mucus buildup in the lungs.
